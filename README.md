# Pomodoro-Timer
A Chrome extension featuring a very basic pomodoro timer with features as   
* A self running pomodoro loop which is a 25 minutes pomodoro followed by a short break, this continues for 4 cycles and then a long break is given.  
* Ability to start any of the three phases as per choice  
* A Pause button to stop the timer if needed.  
* A stop button to completely reset the timer.

I am currently working on some issues and trying to make this usable as a chrome extension.
